## Downloading the Physics-RW dataset
Our data is stored in Physics-RW. Currently, only part of the data has been uploaded. Once the review process is complete, we will update all the data. 
**Dataset URL**: [https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/pengyz/Physics-RW]

There are two methods for downloading:

1. Download via the ModelScope library.
```bash
from modelscope.msdatasets import MsDataset
ds =  MsDataset.load('pengyz/Physics-RW')
```
2.  Download via GiT.
```
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/pengyz/Physics-RW.git
```
